# IMPIA
Integrated Metagenome-metatranscriptome Pipeline for Intra-intestinal Analysis (IMPIA) reconstructs a common reference metagenome across multiple intestinal sites from metagenome read data, allowing for identifying the same genes across sites. 
This approach allows gene expression levels to be compared among multi-site samples including those of unknown genes from metatranscriptome data. 
In addition, spatial covariance analysis predicts the function of unknown genes.
